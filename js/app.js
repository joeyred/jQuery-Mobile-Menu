// Problem: Menu breaks on smaller screens
// Solution: To hide the text links and swap them out for a more appropriate navigation

// Create a select element and append to menu. Options should use text links to get their info.
// Cycle over menu links
	// options value is href
	// options text is the text of the link
	// append option to select
// create button to click to go to select's location
// Bind Click to button
	// Go to select's location
// Modify CSS to hide links on small width and show button and select
	// also hides select and button on larger width and show's links
